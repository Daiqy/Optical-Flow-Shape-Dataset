# Optical-Flow-Shape-Dataset

##Code to create shape data set for optical flow tasks on fly

Each datapoint consist of two images with a randomly generated shape imposed on a black background and its calculated optical flow.

`data_shape.py` is used to create datapoints where a single shape is present
`data_shape_double.py` is used to create datapoints where two shapes are present in each image
